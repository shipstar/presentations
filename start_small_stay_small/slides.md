<br/>
But more generally...

# Micropreneurs + Bootstrappers
* A **micropreneur** wants to create a lifestyle business (or businesses).
* A **bootstrapper** wants to grow up eventually.

!SLIDE
# What do I do?

!SLIDE
# Sell a niche product.
Example: Customer interview tracker for lean practitioners.
<div class="footnote">(I'm cheating by starting with an idea.)</div>

!SLIDE
# 1. Find a niche

!SLIDE
Rule of thumb: Stick to markets where you can take out a full-page ad in a magazine for < $5000.
<div class="footnote">(But don't actually advertise in a magazine.)</div>

!SLIDE
Use keyword analysis to find a market with some demand but little competition.

<br/>
<br/>
Example: "customer interview tracker", "lean interview notes", etc.

!SLIDE
If you find a good niche...

!SLIDE
# 2. Build a mini-sales site.

Home, pricing, and sign-up. Maybe a static product tour.

That's about it.

!SLIDE
Use AdWords to drive traffic to your site.

!SLIDE
Try to get people to click on a "Buy" or "Try now" button.

!SLIDE
(Put up a coming soon banner if you feel bad.)

!SLIDE
Example: Left as an exercise for the reader.

!SLIDE
If you get enough conversions...

!SLIDE
# 3. Build an MVP

!SLIDE
Product is only part of the equation.

<div class="footnote">(You also need a market and marketing/sales/support.)</div>

!SLIDE
Estimate the work:

4-12 hours per page.

10-20 hours for DB design.

10-40 hours for back-end features like payments.

Shoot for 200-400 hours.

!SLIDE smbullets
Pages/features for our customer interview tracker:

* Home / Mini-sales site
* Sign up
* Sign in
* Dashboard

!SLIDE
Cut aggressively.
<div class="footnote">(Do you need scheduling for MVP? What about analysis?)</div>

!SLIDE
Or outsource.

<div class="footnote">(You're trying to evaluate the market. Product is only part of the equation.)</div>

!SLIDE
Section about virtual assistants omitted.

!SLIDE
Spend some time on pricing.

<div class="footnote">(It's hard to change later.)</div>

!SLIDE
# 4. Market

!SLIDE
Prefer email lists, blogging, and organic search

<br/>
<br/>
to

<br/>

social marketing, forums, banner ads, etc.

!SLIDE
The rest of marketing omitted for time.

!SLIDE
# 5. Grow it or start over

!SLIDE
Grow it: go to conferences, add features, hire, expand from a vertical into a horizontal market, etc.

!SLIDE
Start over: Outsource, automate, or sell.
