## Lean startup is a *mindset* that favors:

* tight feedback loops
* talking to customers
* science-like substances

## Feedback loops are awesome.

<br/><br/>
Good: Video games, building things with your hands, high-level languages
<br/><br/>
Bad: Performance reviews, schools at a macro level, punch cards

## Talking to customers is awesome.

<br/><br/>
Most customers want to tell you what they want.
<br/><br/>
The trick is figuring out what they will pay for.

## Science is awesome.

<br/><br/>
Lean isn't strictly science, but it's better than other approaches.
<br/><br/>
Be aware of its limitations.

!SLIDE
